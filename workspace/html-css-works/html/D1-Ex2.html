        Publicis Sapient is an American digital consulting company, founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1990 by Jerry
        Greenberg and J. Stuart Moore.[2][3]

        On February 6, 2015, Sapient became a fully owned division of French advertising giant Publicis, in a deal
        valued at $3.7bn (Â£2.3bn).[4]

        On November 17, 2016, Publicis Sapient announced SapientNitro was merging with sister agency Razorfish to form
        SapientRazorfish, which would be led by former SapientNitro CEO Alan Wexler. Publicis. At the time, Sapient
        consisted of both SapientRazorfish and Sapient Consulting, and was co-led by Alan Wexler and Sapient Consulting
        CEO Chip Register.[5]

        On February 13, 2019, SapientRazorfish and Sapient Consulting were merged into one brand, Publicis Sapient,[6]
        led by Nigel Vaz, who was appointed CEO the prior week.[7]

        After a period of contraction following the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, Sapient looked overseas to
        grow a substantial portion of revenue, rising over 30% in 3 years. This growth was driven by a strategy called
        "Global Distributed Delivery," which sought to capitalize on the quickly growing tech market in India to grow
        Sapient's software development capabilities. The operations in India would supplement project teams globally.[8]

        Sapient has made numerous acquisitions throughout its history, beginning in 2006 with Planning Group
        International. Another important acquisition was DCG group in 2008, which augmented its existing capital markets
        offerings.[9]

        In 2009, Sapient announced a $50 million acquisition of The Nitro Group, which added 300 employees

        Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company with headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
        It develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal
        computers, and related services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating
        systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware
        products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers.
        Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total
        revenue;[3] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2016.[4] It is considered one of the Big
        Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry, along with Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook.

        Microsoft (the word being a portmanteau of "microcomputer software"[5]) was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen
        on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal
        computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. The company's 1986
        initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an
        estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from
        the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition
        of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[6] followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5
        billion in May 2011.[7]

        As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office
        software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[8]
        The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs,
        gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed
        reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).

        Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000, and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy.[9] This
        unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[10] entering the personal computer production market for
        the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming
        Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over
        as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move that
        helped the company's shares reach its highest value since December 1999.[11][12]

        Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly
        traded company in the world.[13] In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the
        third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively.[14] As of 2020,
        Microsoft has the third-highest global brand valuation.[15]

    <p>
        Facebook (stylized as facebook) is an American online social media and social networking service based in Menlo
        Park, California, and a flagship service of the namesake company Facebook, Inc. It was founded by Mark
        Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin
        Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.

        The founders of Facebook initially limited membership to Harvard students. Membership was expanded to Columbia,
        Stanford, and Yale before being expanded to the rest of the Ivy League, MIT, NYU, Boston University, then
        various other universities in the United States and Canada, and lastly high school students. Since 2006, anyone
        who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though this may
        vary depending on local laws. The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university
        students.

        Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and
        smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post
        text, photos and multimedia which is shared with any other users that have agreed to be their "friend", or, with
        a different privacy setting, with any reader. Users can also use various embedded apps, join common-interest
        groups, buy and sell items or services on Marketplace, and receive notifications of their Facebook friends'
        activities and activities of Facebook pages they follow. Facebook said that it had 2.8 billion monthly active
        users as of December 2020,[2] and Facebook was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s globally.[7]

        Facebook has been the subject of numerous controversies, often involving user privacy (as with the Cambridge
        Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections), mass surveillance,[8]
        psychological effects such as addiction and low self-esteem, and content such as fake news, conspiracy theories,
        copyright infringement, and hate speech.[9] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the
        spread of such content and also exaggerating its number of users in order to appeal to
        advertisers.[10][11][12][13][14] As of January 21, 2021, Alexa Internet ranks Facebook seventh in global
        internet usage

    <a name="google">Google</a> <a href="#index">[UP]</a>
    <p>
        Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and
        products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and
        hardware. It is considered one of the five Big Tech companies alongside Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and
        Microsoft.[10][11][12]

        Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford
        University in California. Together they own about 14% of its shares and control 56% of the stockholder voting
        power through super-voting stock. Google was incorporated in California on September 4, 1998. Google was then
        reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.[13] In July 2003, Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain
        View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. The company became a public company via an initial public offering
        (IPO) on August 19, 2004. In October 2015, Google reorganized as a subsidiary of a conglomerate called Alphabet
        Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Sundar
        Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. In 2021, the Alphabet
        Workers Union was founded, mainly composed of Google employees.[14]

        The company's rapid growth since incorporation has included products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond
        Google's core search engine, (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google
        Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud
        storage (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Google Duo, Hangouts, Google Chat, and Google Meet),
        language translation (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, and Street
        View), podcast hosting (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube), blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking
        (Google Keep and Jamboard), and photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development
        of the Android mobile operating system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS, a lightweight operating
        system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered
        with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Google Nexus devices, and it released multiple
        hardware products in October 2016, including the Google Pixel line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker,
        Google Wifi mesh wireless router, and Google Daydream virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with
        becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber, Google Fi, and Google Station).[15]

        Google.com is the most visited website worldwide. Several other Google-owned websites also are on the list of
        most popular websites, including YouTube and Blogger.[16]

        On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[17] and fourth by Interbrand.[18] It has
        received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, antitrust, censorship,
        and search neutrality.
